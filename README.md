 Artificial Cockroach Escape System
 After my research, I decided to implement a simple version of the algorithm in Java. It is not close to how it is supposed to be, but I managed to build a good basis, I believe.
 
 Right now, you can't fully personalize your experience without hard coding the statistics you want, but the simulation starts with 3 (simple) agents represented by the letter 'I' that move randomly and 1 enemy agent represented by the letter 'E' that hunts those agents. The agents' goal is to reach the final state 'F' without being eaten by the enemy first. Yes, they are playing tag. Obstacles are represented by the letter 'O', and food is represented by the symbol '$'.
